      <h1><b>A brief introduction about me</b></h1>
      <p>
        I'm a <span style= {{color:"green"}}><b>MERN stack</b></span> developer who loves to code as much as I love my late-night <span style= {{color:"green"}}><b>anime binges</b></span> and <span style= {{color:"green"}}><b>epic gaming marathons</b></span>.I build web apps that are as smooth and dynamic as a perfectly executed combo move. When I'm not conquering code, you can find me <span style = {{color:"green"}}><b>jamming out on my guitar</b></span> , lost in the world of anime, or leveling up in my favorite games. My creative energy from music and the imaginative worlds of anime and gaming keep my coding skills sharp and my projects unique. Dive into my portfolio and let's embark on a journey where <span style = {{color:"green"}}><b>tech</b></span>, <span style = {{color:"green"}}><b>tunes</b></span>, and <span style = {{color:"green"}}><b>otaku vibes</b></span> collide!
